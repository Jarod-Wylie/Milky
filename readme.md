Introduction/Background
To create a visual interface that brings more awareness to how much we don’t know about the Milky Way Galaxy and the objects it contains.

MoSCoW
	
	Must Have:
A way to users can make profiles that contain their name and their education credentials.
Input fields that that add positions of objects: Systems; Black Holes; Planets; Moons; Belts
This information is saved and the Milky Way is Generated on load of the page.
A visual interface that displays the types of objects - see specifications for Galaxy

	
	Should Have:
A favorite button that adds an object to a list.
Be able to zoom in/ click to sections of the galaxy -> quadrants -> systems -> objects.
Objects are clickable and bring up information and pictures created by users.
Paths and speeds of the objects around each other.

	Could Have:
Color coding button that shows a hierarchy of how much information we have on regions of the Milky (shown in saturation of red with Earth as the highest standard).
Could have a future simulator showing place of objects in their paths.
Could Have a little rocket image that you choose speeds and can move towards other objects in real time(tries to simulate how long it would take to get between places).
Rocket and planets have rigid bodys
Some kind of simulated gravity that is exerted on the rocket
Add fantasy systems that only the user views.

	Won’t Have:

The map will not have a way to represent a three dimensional Milky Way.
A way for interstellar users to have access to the application
This will not be accurate to the real position of objects in the Milky and their location.



Personas:

Qualified Hobbyists: Really likes astronomy and knows enough to edit the information with some degree of accuracy - finds the interface fun to use and likes to feel smart.

Teachers: Wants a fun interactive website their students can use exploring space and get a better feel on what we know about our distant neighbors.

Alien Bablap: Likes to travel the universe and an app that helps it find near systems and planets in orbit to his location would be great.

Astronomers: Annoyed such a inaccurate application exists and want to critique it’s user’s contributions and the relative accuracy of the web app.



Personas Analysis:

This project’s aim is to lay a foundation for fulfilling the desires of the personas. The personas are the ideal audience for which I would hope the web app to be used by.

Qualified Hobbyists: 
Is tech savvy but interface needs some amount of teaching to use an make content.
Has most common objects for them to add: black holes, sun, etc.

Teachers: 
The exploration interface is needs to be very easy to use for children.
Interface is colorful and attention grabbing
Displays content clearly.

Astronomer:
A way to clearly identify astronomer based on profile type and the educational credentials.
Astronomer can rate how accurate a the description of an object in space is. 1-100
Astronomer can obviously edit information.

Alien Bablap:
Calculates the positions of objects their orbit for a specified time.
